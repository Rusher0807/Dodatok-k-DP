    "reasoning": "Benign. This is a standard function prologue in x86 assembly, typically generated by compilers. It saves the old base pointer (ebp), sets up the new stack frame (mov ebp, esp), aligns the stack pointer (and esp), and allocates space for local variables (sub esp)."

    "reasoning": "Benign. This is a standard function epilogue. It restores the stack pointer to deallocate local variables (mov esp, ebp), restores the caller's base pointer (pop ebp), and returns control to the caller, adjusting the stack pointer by an additional 0x10 bytes to clean up arguments passed on the stack (ret 0x10)."

    "reasoning": "Benign. The code calls the 'IsThemeActive' function from UxTheme.dll. This is a standard Windows API call used to check if visual styles (themes) are currently enabled in the operating system. Programs often use this for UI rendering decisions."

    "reasoning": "Yes. The code detects virtual machines (\"Virtual machine detected!\") and debuggers (\"Debugger detected!\"). It then performs repeated XOR transformations and multiple calls to the same function, typical of obfuscated or malicious routines."
